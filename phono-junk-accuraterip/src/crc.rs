//! AccurateRip CRC v1 / v2 computation over streaming PCM sectors.
//!
//! Consumes an iterator of [`PcmSector`] (588 stereo samples packed as
//! little-endian `L | (R << 16)` `u32` values per CDDA frame) and emits
//! a [`TrackCrc`]. Both variants are computed in a single pass to avoid
//! per-sample divergence between v1 and v2 implementations.
//!
//! Algorithm reference: `.claude/skills/phono-archive/formats/AccurateRip.md`.
//! Formulas cross-verified against [leo-bogert/accuraterip-checksum]
//! (<https://github.com/leo-bogert/accuraterip-checksum>) and
//! [arcctgx/ARver](https://github.com/arcctgx/ARver).
//!
//! ## Skip bounds
//!
//! AccurateRip ignores the first 5 CDDA frames (2940 samples) of the
//! disc's first track and the last 5 CDDA frames of the disc's last
//! track to absorb drive-offset variance near the disc boundaries. On a
//! single-track disc both skips apply simultaneously.
//!
//! The check window is `check_start ..= check_end`, inclusive, on the
//! 1-indexed sample position that runs across the whole track.
//!
//! For first/only tracks, `check_start = SKIP_SAMPLES`, i.e. position
//! 2940 is the first *included* position — matching ARver's and
//! leo-bogert's `multiplier >= skip_frames` condition. (Some secondary
//! references describe the skip as "positions 1..=2940 excluded", which
//! is off-by-one; the reference implementations include 2940.)
